## Installation Instructions

Before running the project, make sure to install the necessary packages. There are two types of installations: **global** and **local**. Please follow the instructions below to set up your environment correctly.

### Global Installation (can be run from any directory)

The following commands need to be run globally to make Vue CLI and Vue available across your entire system:

    `npm install vue -g`
    `npm install @vue/cli -g`

These commands install vue and @vue/cli globally, allowing you to use Vue commands like vue create from anywhere in your terminal.


2. Local Installation (must be run in the project directory)
The following commands should be executed in the root directory of your project (CoffeeBean-main), where the package.json file is located:

Navigate to your project directory:
ex) cd "C:\Users\username\OneDrive\바탕 화면\vue_projects\CoffeeBean-main"

Then run the local installation commands:

    `npm install axios`
    `npm install vue-router`
    `npm install web3`


3. In the project directory, you can run:
    ### `npm run serve`
